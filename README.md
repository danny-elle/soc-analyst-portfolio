#  SOC Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my SOC Analyst portfolio. This repository showcases hands-on blue team exercises, write-ups, and python blue team based scripts Iâ€™ve completed to build my career as a Tier 1 SOC Analyst.

##  Write-Ups

| Title | Description | Link |
|-------|-------------|------|
|  Wireshark Traffic Analysis | Analysis of anomalies and protocol behavior using Wireshark | [View](writeups/wireshark-analysis.md) |
|  Anti-Reverse Engineering  | Techniques malware uses to evade analysis and how to detect/analyze them   |[View](writeups/anti-reverse-engineering.md) |

## SOC Scripts

| Title | Description | Link |
|-------|-------------|------|
|  Python Network Sniffer   | A Scapy network packet sniffer that displays source/destination IPs, TCP ports, and TCP flags. Built to simulate real-time traffic inspection in SOC setting | [View](network-sniffer/simple_sniffer.py)  |
| Python IOC IPs |  Detects and logs IP addresses involved in threats. Categorizes them by severity and threat type. | [View]() |
| Python Suspicious Ports | Detects and alerts which ports are used for malicious activity. | [View]() |
| Python Time-based Threat Detection | Checks alerts for any activity within the past hour. | [View]() |

##  Skills Demonstrated

- Packet capture and analysis (Wireshark, Scapy)
- Threat detection and protocol dissection
- CyberChef decoding and credential hunting
- Identifying Nmap scans, ARP spoofing, DNS tunneling, etc.
- Real-world SOC workflows
- Reverse engineering basics using tools like Detect It Easy, IDA Pro, x64dbg, Task Manager, and pestudio
- Detecting and analyzing anti-debugging and VM-detection techniques
- Windows API behavior analysis
- Using base64 decoding, memory inspection, and entropy analysis for malware unpacking
